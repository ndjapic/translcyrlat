## Transliteration utility between serbian latin and serbian cyrillic

Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/translcyrlat

Small tool (a single html file - purely client javascript application - works directly from your web browser) for translation between serbian latin and serbian cyrrilic letters. In serbian language there are/were two letter types allowed: latin letters and cyrillic letters. This tool does translation between those two. It does not preserve markup made by a text procesor. Only notepad (pure .txt) documents are fully supported.
